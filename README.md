# Team A Cohort project 

### Some rules for Pull Requests
1. Include the Jira Issue Number (DSD100-##), your initials, and the subject of the issue in the Pull Request Title
  Exmple - DSD1000-1_ba_InitialRepositoryCommit
2. In the Pull Request description, include comments about your changes, how to test them (if applicable) or any relevant screenshots
  I'll make a template for this!


### Branching
1. Include the Jira Issue Number for the task you're currently working on followed by your initials and a brief description of the task, just like with the PR requests
  IE: DSD100-1_ba_ThisIsTheIssue
2.
